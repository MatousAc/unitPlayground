  <h1>Privacy Policy for UnitPlayground</h1>

  <p>Wow! Look at you. You're actually reading the privacy policy.</p>
  <p>
    The gist of it is that I don't really want your data. I don't use it, store
    it, sell it or anything. I never even see it or ask for it. I only ask users
    to authenticate so that I can store their settings or their past work in a
    database.
  </p>
  <p>Of course, if you're into the legal mumbo-jumbo, it's right here:</p>

  <p>
    At UnitPlayground, accessible from <a href="unitplayground.com">
      unitplayground.com
    </a>
    , one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy
    document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by UnitPlayground
    and how we use it.
